# Project 1 – Automation

## Description
This automation suite demonstrates hands-on experience with Selenium WebDriver, Java, TestNG, and Maven, focused on mastering UI automation through a series of real-world scenarios and exercises.
The project covers end-to-end test cases including login workflows, dropdown interactions, checkbox validations, calendar handling, alert popups, and a dynamic product cart challenge modeled on real-world e-commerce behavior.

All test cases are structured in two formats:
- Without TestNG – Basic script executions.
- With TestNG – Organized test cases with assertions and annotations for test lifecycle management.

## Tech Stack
- Selenium WebDriver  
- Java  
- TestNG  
- Maven  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., Eclipse)  
3. Run the test file (without TestNG framework):  
   `'without TESTNG FreamWork/<filename>.java'`  
4. Run the test file (with TestNG framework):  
   `'With TESTNG/<filename>.java'`

## Day 1 – Basic Locators & Login Flow

- Used basic element locators to launch the page and tested login functionality with invalid data.  
- Then navigated to the forgot password page, fetched a temporary password, and successfully logged in.  

### What I Learned
- Setting up Selenium with Java  
- Basic element locators  
- Writing and running TestNG tests  

---

## Day 2 – Static Dropdown

- Learned to handle **static dropdowns** using the `Select` tag in the DOM.  

### What I Learned
1. Static dropdowns use the `<select>` tag.  
2. Options are fixed and do not change dynamically.  
3. Order of values remains the same.  

---

## Day 3 – Dynamic Dropdown

- Dynamic dropdowns load options based on other selections (e.g., "From" and "To" cities).  

### What I Learned
1. Options load **only after** selecting a value in the "From" dropdown.  
2. Used **parent-child XPaths** and **index-based XPaths**.  

---

## Day 4 – Suggestive Dropdown

- Handled **suggestive/autocomplete dropdowns** where suggestions appear as you type.

### What I Learned
1. Used `sendKeys()` to trigger suggestions.  
2. Captured suggestion list using `findElements()`.  
3. Selected desired value using a loop.  

---

## Day 5 – Custom Dropdown

- Automated dropdowns that use increment/decrement controls (not `<select>` tags).

### What I Learned
1. Used **loops (while and for)** to change the passenger count.  
2. Validated values using `getText()`.  
3. Applied assertions using TestNG.  

### Key Highlights
- Opened passenger selection panel  
- Increased adults with `while` loop  
- Decreased adults with `for` loop  
- Used assertions to validate expected count  

---

## Day 6 – Checkbox

### What I Learned
1. Automated checkbox selection/deselection.  
2. Verified selection state with `isSelected()`.  
3. Counted total checkboxes on the page.  
4. Used `CSS Selector` with `id*='friendsandfamily'`.

### Key Highlights
- Asserted checkbox is **not selected** initially.  
- Selected checkbox and asserted it **is selected**.  
- Counted all checkboxes with `findElements().size()`.  

---

## Assignment 1 - Checkbox Automation Exercise

### Objective
To automate and validate checkbox behavior using Selenium + Java.

### Code Flow
1. Launch browser  
2. Validate default checkbox state  
3. Select, validate selection  
4. Deselect, validate again  
5. Print checkbox state  
6. Count total checkboxes  

### Key Concepts Practiced
- `isSelected()`  
- `Assert.assertTrue()` / `Assert.assertFalse()`  
- Counting with `findElements()`  
- Using `CSS Selectors` for efficiency  

---

## Amazon Interview Challenge - Selenium Automation

This project is a solution to a common e-commerce QA automation challenge inspired by an **Amazon interview question**. The requirement was to add selected products to the cart, even as **new products are added dynamically** to the online store.

##  Problem Statement

> **"New products are added daily to the Amazon marketplace. Automate the process of adding specific items to the cart regardless of how the product list changes."**

## Solution Strategy

I faced several key challenges while working on this and here’s how I tackled them:

###  Problem 1: Hardcoded Product Names
- **Issue**: Couldn’t check individual items one by one.
- **Solution**: Created a **generic array** (`String[] itemNeeded`) and matched it dynamically.

###  Problem 2: Mismatched Product Names
- **Issue**: The UI displayed product names with additional data (e.g., "Tomato - 1 Kg").
- **Solution**: Used `split("-")` and `trim()` to extract clean product names.

###  Problem 3: Array Iteration Limitations
- **Issue**: Arrays are less flexible for dynamic operations.
- **Solution**: Converted the array to a **List** using `Arrays.asList()`.

###  Problem 4: Button Click Failing After First Click
- **Issue**: XPath based on static text failed as button text changed after clicking.
- **Solution**: Switched to a **parent-child XPath strategy**:  
  ```java
  //div[@class='product-action']/button
###  Problem 5: Loop Continuation After All Items Are Added
Issue: The loop kept running even after all products were added.

Solution: Used a counter j and a break once all required items were added.

## Key Learnings
- How to make automation code resilient to UI changes.
- Improved use of XPath strategies and DOM traversal.
- Practiced writing scalable and reusable code in real-world-like scenarios.

##  Day 9 – Synchronization in Selenium using Implicit and Explicit Waits

When automating modern web applications, timing issues are one of the trickiest challenges.

Elements don’t always load instantly — some appear in milliseconds, while others take seconds due to dynamic content. That’s where synchronization comes in, and Selenium offers powerful wait mechanisms to handle it: Implicit Wait and Explicit Wait.

Today, I implemented both in a real-time scenario. Here’s what I learned 👇

 Implicit Wait
- Applied globally across all elements.
- Tells WebDriver to wait for a certain duration when trying to find an element if it's not immediately available.

 Pros:
 - Easy to implement
 - Useful for stable, consistently loading elements
 - Reduces code repetition
 
 Cons:
 - Not ideal for elements with varying load times
 - Applies to all elements — may slow down test execution unnecessarily
 - Can’t wait for specific conditions (e.g., text change, alert present)

 Explicit Wait
- More powerful and flexible.
- Used to wait for a specific condition or element to occur before continuing the script.

 Pros:
 - Targeted & condition-based
 - Prevents flakiness in dynamic scenarios
 - Can wait for element state changes, visibility, clicks, etc.
 
 Cons:
 - More code to write for each dynamic element
 - Misuse can lead to longer waits or timeout exceptions
 - Needs clear understanding of element behavior

 Real Scenario I Automated:
 - Selected a list of grocery items dynamically from the UI
 - Verified cart functionality and price updates
 - Applied promo code & waited for the success message with Explicit Wait


 Key Takeaways
 - Use Implicit Wait as a default, but don’t rely on it for slow elements
 - Use Explicit Wait for dynamic, conditional elements (like popups, loaders, alerts)
 - Always observe app behavior and apply the right wait for optimal stability

 ## Test Case Overview
 Steps Covered
- Open browser and navigate to the site
- Select items: Brocolli, Tomato, Pumpkin, Mango, Pomegranate, Almonds, Cashews
- Click Cart and Proceed to Checkout
- Apply promo code: rahulshettyacademy
- Wait for success message using Explicit Wait
- Print the promo confirmation message
- Close the browser

# Day 10 – Fluent Wait in Selenium with TestNG

This project demonstrates the use of **Fluent Wait** in Selenium WebDriver using Java and TestNG. It handles a real-time scenario where elements take time to become visible on a dynamically loaded page.

##  Scenario

Website Tested: [Dynamic Loading Page](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/dynamic_loading/1)

- After clicking the **Start** button, the content takes a few seconds to appear.
- The element is already in the DOM but not immediately visible.
- We use Fluent Wait to wait until the element becomes **visible** before proceeding.

##  Code Highlights

- `FluentWait` is configured to:
  - Wait up to 30 seconds
  - Poll every 3 seconds
  - Ignore `NoSuchElementException`
- Conditional logic inside the `apply()` method waits until the element becomes visible.

What I Learned
- Fluent Wait allows more flexibility for handling dynamic elements.
- Polling helps reduce test flakiness.
- You can apply conditional logic inside until() to wait until an element meets a specific condition.
